<h1>Great Depression</h1><hr />

<p>
The <strong><i>Great Depression</strong></i> was a severe worldwide economic depression between 1929
 and 1939 that began after a major fall in stock prices in the United States. 
The economic contagion<br /> began around September 4<sup>th</sup>, 1929, and became known
 worldwide on <b>Black Tuesday</b>, the stock market crash of October 29<sup>th</sup>, 1929.

</p>

<p>Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide (GDP) fell by an estimated 15%.
 By comparison, worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009
 during the Great Recession. Some economies<br /> started to recover by the
 mid-1930s. However, in many countries, the negative effects of 
the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II.

<h2>Causes</h2><hr />

<h3>
Productivity shock
</h3>

<p><blockquote>It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the
 [productivity, output, and employment] trends we are describing are long-time
 trends and were thoroughly evident before 1929.<br /> These trends are in nowise
 the result of the present depression, nor are they the result of the World War.
 On the contrary, the present depression is a collapse resulting<br /> from these
 long-term trends.</blockquote>

<strong><blockquote>-M. King Hubbert
</strong></blockquote>


<p>The first three decades of the 20th century 
saw economic output surge with electrification, mass production, and motorized
 farm machinery, and because of the rapid growth in<br /> productivity there was a lot
 of excess production capacity and the work week was being reduced.</p>

Books</h2><hr />
<p><em>

The Great Depression: A Diary</em> was written by Benjamin Roth, 
a lawyer from Youngstown, Ohio. It outlines the state of affairs that he and
 many other middle-class Americans faced<br /> following the crash of
 the stock market. Business was tanking and people were spending less money
 on many services, lawyers included.</p>


<p><em>A Rabble of Dead Money</em> written by Charles R. Morris delves into the factors that led to
 the Great Crash of 1929. The United States had been poised to become 
a superpower at the time,<br />

but the stock market crash was a stumbling block
 that would halt national and economic growth for over a decade.

</p>

<p><em>A Commonwealth of Hope</em> By Alan Lawson is a meticulous study
 of not only the Great Depression, but of the legislation designed to pull 
the United States out of it. Lawson examines the<br /> circumstances surrounding
 the ideation, creation, and implementation of the New Deal.</p>
